<h2>1. MOISTURIZE YOUR SKIN</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You take care of all the organs inside your body, but what are you doing to care for your largest organ – your skin? An adult carries around about 8 pounds of skin, so you need to make sure it’s healthy. Moisture is the number one way to keep your skin healthy. Drink plenty of water. And if your skin still feels a little dry, apply lotion after you shower. Use a body lotion on, well, your body and get a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aveda.com/product/5342/16778/Men/Skin-Care/Aveda-Men-Pure-Formance-Dual-Action-Aftershave/index.tmpl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">face moisturizer</a>&nbsp;for your face.</p>

<h2>2. PROTECT YOUR FACE WHEN YOU SHAVE</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shaving can cause irritation and in-grown hairs. Ouch. Plus, men’s skin is more prone to sensitivity, so if you’re not using a shaving cream when you groom your face, you need to be. Look for shave creams with soothing, anti-oxidant ingredients. We like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aveda.com/product/5342/17150/Men/Skin-Care/Aveda-Men-Pure-Formance-Shave-Cream/index.tmpl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aveda’s Men Pure-Formance shave cream</a>. If you struggle with redness when you shave, a soothing shave cream will save your skin. Notice we didn’t say shave gels. Gels tend to have more alcohol, which increases the risk of dry skin.</p>

<h2>3. CLEANSE YOUR FACE</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women aren’t the only ones who need to wash and cleanse their faces. Pollution, dust, sweat and dirt from just daily activities can clog your pores. At the end of the day, you need to wash your face to clean all that gunk from your skin.</p>

<p>Cleansers help remove excess oil, so if you struggle with acne or oil, you’ll want to add a<a href="http://www.aveda.com/product/5342/16929/Men/Skin-Care/Botanical-Kinetics-Purifying-Gel-Cleanser/index.tmpl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;daily cleanser&nbsp;</a>into your morning or night routine.</p>

<h2>4. USE SHAMPOO FOR MEN</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Men’s scalps are different than women’s. A man’s scalp is more likely to become itchy, irritated and react poorly to certain ingredients. Because of this, men should use hair products tailored to them. A man’s scalp also tends to produce more oil than a women’s, so you need a shampoo that can cleanse hair without over drying it. You need to find a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aveda.com/product/5341/41222/Men/Hair-Care/new-invati-men-nourishing-exfoliating-shampoo/index.tmpl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shampoo built for men</a>&nbsp;to keep your hair and scalp happy without drying either out.</p>

<h2>5. MEN CAN USE CONDITIONER TOO</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may have heard that guys don’t need conditioner. If your hair is under two inches, you might be able to get by without using it, but if you have longer hair, you’ll definitely want to add a bottle of conditioner to you shower shelf. Conditioner will add back any moisture your shampoo strips away.</p>

<h2>6. MINIMIZE WRINKLES</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to keeping skin moisturized, your diet will help keep wrinkles to a minimum. Watery fruits and veggies help with hydration, which keeps skin youthful. Add watermelon, tomatoes, cucumbers and lemons into your diet. Also eat more cabbage. It contains vitamin C and vitamin A, both of which help erase lines. It also detoxifies the blood, and the fiber in cabbage pushes waste and toxins out of the body. Toxins can actually show up on your face, making you look older than you are.</p>

<h2>7. EMBRACE THE BROW WAX</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re stealing a tip from women. Ladies shouldn’t be the only ones grooming their brows. To really enhance their facial features, guys should pluck and groom their brows. Keep the unibrows at bay by plucking on your own. To really get a handsome shape, visit a professional for a waxing.</p>

<h2>8. KEEP YOUR LIPS SOFT</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a simple beauty tip for men: use lip balm! Lips age drastically and they can dry out fast. Throw a lip balm, preferably one with sun protection, into your pocket and apply it throughout the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>9. WHITEN YOUR SMILE</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your smile is one of the first things people notice about you. Healthy, white teeth not only look nice, but they’ll save you time and money at the dentist’s office. Brushing, flossing and using mouthwash on a daily basis lowers the risk of gum disease, cavities, bleeding and infections. These can cause serious damage down the road. If you smoke or drink a lot of coffee, talk to your dentist about whitening options.</p>

<p>Noticing bags under the eyes? It could be because you’re not getting enough rest. The average adult needs&nbsp;<a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need/page/0/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">between 7 and 9</a>&nbsp;hours of sleep. If you’re still seeing bags under your eyes, you can reduce the puffliness by placing cold spoons on your eyes. Also, chilled raw potato slices placed under the eyes for around 20 minutes can help reduce dark circles. They contain catecholase, a skin-lightening enzyme.</p>

<p>Even if you can’t work all of these beauty tips for men into your daily routine, starting to do a few of these will help your skin, hair and teeth. You’ll look better, but more importantly, you’ll feel better!</p>
